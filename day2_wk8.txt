WDYL? [07/23/19]

today we worked more on the website, well, tony n diego worked on it
i mostly just worked on the powerpoint bc diego took over the contact
page lmao

but, im really glad that i signed up for this class. its taught me a lot
about teamwork, and keeping a level head, especially when things get
overwhelming. also, charity navigator is a bitch (competitor to
our site).

this class has also helped me realize that instead of constantly wondering
if i'm being useless to the team, i could literally just ask if there's 
anything i should be doing atm. like, seriously, when i get anxious,
common sense goes out the window i stg.

anyway, last week, so theres obviously a lot of emotions brewing.
tbh, i love the guys here, despite the frustration with being a femalien
lmao. i really hope that the friends i made here last me until i finish
high school. <3
