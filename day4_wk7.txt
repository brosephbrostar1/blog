WDYL? [07/17/19]

today we worked on the thingy further, i finished the wirefram-esque thing for the databases
it sucks because databases are what i suck the most at, im alright at front-end and most of the
other things, but this just kinda throws me for a loop sometimes. but! i did end up learning more about
how they work, so now im better at it, and i'll be prepared for next time i get suckerpunched with
the dirtywork lmao
at least now we have a good footing on the project, im actually kinda proud of how we're pulling
this all together :D
