WDYL? [07/16/19]

today we worked on the password thingie from yesterday, but because i wasn't here that kinda complicates things.
but!! i did get into my final project groups with Tony and Diego, both of which eat my snacks the most lmao.
we ended up thinking about making a randomized button site that takes you to different charities.
y'know, taking advantage of the publics small attention span, right?
man, we're cruel.
