What did you learn? [06/06/19]

I learned that most of the things I'll be doing in this class will be hard work and trial+error.
I also learned that I genuinely like being able to create things and see them work, even when they don't have a higher purpose.
I originally thought that this class would be tiring and boring, which the former is true, but it's honestly pretty worht it.
I recognize that not many people get this oppotunity, so for those that can't, as well as for myself, I plan on seeing this program through.
