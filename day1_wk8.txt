WDYL? [07/22/19]

today we did social media logins for the project! i also learned that i didnt add a 
configuration for the databases, which is a quick fix, but it sucked to know that i had something missing.
other than that, i have the tsrat of a contact page, so at least im not completely useless to the team.
hopefully i'll be upgraded to 30% lmao
