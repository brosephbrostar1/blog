WDYL? [07/09/19]

learned more about sql and went over the todo folder to further understand the relationships between
each element, but it kinda went in one ear and out the other.
i have a migraine and our project is kinda weird looking but i hope it works out.
i also hope that bren forgives me for being useless today in terms of helping with the project,
it was hard to do anything without being reminded that my skull felt like a maracca
(however you spell that).
